# refuse: a minimal blog theme for Hugo

This is just a from scratch rewrite of the amazing
[Basic](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-basic/) blog
theme for Hugo in an attempt to make it *smaller*:

* no `css` frameworks, just plain, old school, device friendly `css`
  (~3kB minified along with
  [`normalize.css`](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/));
* use of Hugo's builtin
  [menu system](https://gohugo.io/content-management/menus/);
* extensive use of Hugo's
  [block templates](https://gohugo.io/templates/base/).
